# STEGGHOST_ORG_BOUNDARY_MIRROR_HANDOFF.md

Status: ACTIVE
Updated: 2026-08-31

## Goal
Establish StegGhost/.github as the canonical organizational ingress/egress definition for StegGhost.

## Current task authority
1. This handoff is the source of truth for org-boundary/* in this repository.
2. Cross-organization traffic is represented as governed InTr envelopes at this boundary.
3. Individual repositories expose application/runtime profiles and must not independently redefine organization-level transport semantics.
4. HB or HB-derived carriers provide synchronization/carrier capability only; they grant no admission, execution, credential, routing, transition, receiving, publication, or release authority.
5. GitHub Actions may validate source/evidence, but GitHub runtime is not execution authority.

## Canonical layering
HB or HB-derived carrier -> InTr org boundary -> ingestion/normalization -> core-lite registry/routing -> repository/runtime profile.
Return path: endpoint result -> evidence binding -> org egress -> InTr -> carrier.

## Organization repositories currently registered for boundary profiling
- StegGhost/entity-sandbox-runner
- StegGhost/telemetry
- StegGhost/automated_buildout
- StegGhost/stegverse-sandbox
- StegGhost/StegCGE
- StegGhost/ghost-pat-lab

## Immediate implementation
- org-boundary/README.md
- org-boundary/schemas/intr-envelope.schema.json
- org-boundary/evidence/receipt-chain.schema.json
- org-boundary/registry/services.json
- stegverse.architecture.json

## Evidence semantics
Source presence, CI success, merge, deployment, activation, ingress receipt, dispatch, consumption, observation, egress, and same-execution reconstruction are distinct states.

## Next
Replace generic INTERNAL_ENDPOINT entries with tighter endpoint-specific profiles as each repository's own handoff and runtime contract are reconciled.


## Canonical resident-runtime activation rule — 2026-08-31
- Every StegGhost resident runtime activation surface MUST be kept in `StegGhost/.github`.
- No application repository is the organization resident-runtime activation authority.
- Application repositories expose capabilities/endpoints to the organizational boundary; the organization `.github` owns activation, ingress, egress, and organization-crossing transport behavior.
- All communication crossing the StegGhost organizational boundary MUST be generated through this `.github` boundary using Interlock/InTr semantics.
- Ingress responsibilities: carrier observation, InTr envelope validation, provenance binding, transition-context binding, destination/profile resolution, dispatch evidence.
- Egress responsibilities: result/evidence validation, destination-org resolution, InTr envelope generation, egress evidence, reconstruction linkage.
- HB/HB-derived carrier presence remains non-authorizing. Authority is determined by applicable transition elements.
- GitHub Actions may validate or transport evidence, but GitHub-hosted workflow execution is not required as sovereign runtime authority.
- Canonical implementation paths: `org-boundary/runtime/`, `org-boundary/registry/`, `org-boundary/schemas/`, `org-boundary/evidence/`, `resident-runtime/`.
- Any legacy resident activation implementation outside `StegGhost/.github` becomes an endpoint/provider to this boundary or must be migrated here; it must not remain a competing organizational activation point.
